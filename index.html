Kandy is both an administrative and religious city and is also the capital of the Central Province. Kandy is the home of the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1988.[2] Historically the local Buddhist rulers resisted Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonial expansion and occupation.</p>
